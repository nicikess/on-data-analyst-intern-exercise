# On Running Product Creation Data Analyst Intern Application

This repository contains the results of the Product Creation Data Analyst Intern position exercise at On. It includes a presentation with the exercise results and a Streamlit tool.

## Presentation

The `presentation.pdf` file in this repository presents the results of the analysis.

## Tool

The tool helps to explore the impact of the **Actual FOB $** and the **Retail Price** on the **Margin**. The best way to run the tool is to download this repository. To install the required libraries run **pip install -r requirements.txt** in the root directory of the downloaded repository. To execute the streamlit application simply run **streamlit run tool.py**. This will directly open the application in your browser.
