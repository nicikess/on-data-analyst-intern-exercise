# On Running Product Creation Data Analyst Intern Application

This repository contains the results of the Product Creation Data Analyst Intern position exercise at On. It includes a presentation with the exercise results and a Streamlit tool.

## Presentation

The `presentation.pdf` file in this repository presents the results of the analysis.

## Tool

The tool helps to explore the impact of the **Actual FOB $** and the **Retail Price** on the **Margin**. The best way to run the tool is to download this repository and execute **streamlit run tool.py** in terminal or cmd. This will directly open the application in your browser.

## Contact

If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me at nicolaskesseli@gmail.com. I would be happy to address any queries or discuss the analysis in more detail.

Thank you for considering my application.
